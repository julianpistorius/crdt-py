# Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) for Python

A library, that provides Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) for distributed Python applications. The intent of this middleware is to provide a simple interface for handling CRDTs and to use them in Python applications. For more information on CRDT, read [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type).

[Sai Teja Ranuva](https://github.com/saitejar) and I created this library for our CS 237 - Distributed Systems Middleware class, at University of California, Irvine in the Spring of 2016.
